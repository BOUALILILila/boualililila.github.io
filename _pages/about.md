I'm a Data Scientist at [Mindflow](https://www.) where I work on cyber-operations automation with Agentic AI based on Large Language Models. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the [University of Toulouse III - Paul Sabaiter](https://www.univ-tlse3.fr/) in 2022, where I was a member of the [IRIT](https://www.irit.fr/en/home/) lab.

My research interests include Information Retrieval (IR) and Natural Language Processing (NLP).
